									<h3>Judo</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/judo.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>
                                    This sport is the reason I am where I am today and most importantly why I am the person I have become.  To put it in perspective, when you practice a sport for 16 of your 20 years it is very hard to know any other lifestyle. Growing up, this sport was part of my identity; all I was taught since I was 4 years old was to excel academically and fight to win. And naturally, I grew up to excel at school and win as the Puerto Rican national champion of my category various years. The discipline and perseverance this sport instilled in me is something I will never be able to shake away. I will fight to win and learn from my losses to come back stronger.

                                    My career and accolades throughout high school:

                                    Below is a list of some competitions I participated in (sadly I didn't win them all) and some accolades I received in the last 4 years of my high school (2011-2015). 

                                    </p>
