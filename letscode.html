								<h3>Let's Code</h3>
                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/letscode.png" alt="" /></span><p>For the second semester of my sophomore year I got involved with the Let's Code initiative of the Student International Business Council (SIBC). Along with the STEM director and a CSE major friend of mine, we were able to structure the program, prepare lectures, and teach 200+ students the basics on web development. To some extent this program felt like my child for the entire semester: not only did I feel that the STEM director and the dozens of students were depending on me to give good classes, but I felt that this was my first opportunity to leave my mark at the university. I treated the entire program as a startup, and so I sought to make a successful one by applying design-thinking concepts I had learned in my design classes and by developing the program around the business students' needs. I also incorporated an easy to fill survey that would allow me to know if the pace of the classes were too fast or too boring. I dedicated many hours to each and every lecture, to make sure that the information presented in the slides was anything but complicated and boring. I wanted to captivate the audience's attention and I wanted them to learn because in essence their success would by my own. We also incorporated a way to record all lectures and I developed a side <b><a href="https://jorginazario.github.io/letscode/">website</a></b> for the course with all the videos and slides accessible to students 24/7. I was able to drastically improve my web development skills in preparation for questions and develop my public speaking skills.<br>
 
                                <b>A little bit more about the program specifics:</b> Throughout the entire semester, my colleague and I were able to teach basic internet concepts, languages, technologies, and frameworks they could use to create their own resume websites. We taught basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but most importantly how to use them all together to create an interactive web page. </p>
