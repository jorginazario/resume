									<h3>Student International Business Council (SIBC) Google Social Entrepreneurship</h3>
                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Google_Group.JPG" alt="" /></span><p>Going into my second semester as a freshman, I learned the SIBC offered Social Entrepreneurship projects. These projects are essentially initiatives that the firms we are representing set up for the benefit of non-governmental-organizations (NGOs). I would have the opportunity to make an impact in a real NGO at the same time I built work-experience; so after looking over all the projects, Google's PEPY project sparked my interest the most. In this program I would have the opportunity to work extensively with <b>Google Analytics</b> and <b>Google AdWords</b> to improve the performance of the PEPY NGO website and increase website donations. For the first few weeks I focused heavily on the new Google AdWords campaign by studying the old campaigns they had tried in the past and trying new campaign ideas. The early parts of the project was mostly research focused on marketing strategy. After a month working in that division, I had the opportunity to join in with the people researching the actual website performance with Google Analytics. I learned about the power that an application such as Google Analytics (and Google in general) has, and how it has the capability to not only identify the entire user flow of any person that surfs through their website, but can also pin-point the geographic location of each and every user as to inform the administrator of the website where most of the client base lives. At the end of the semester we were able to present our insights to Google at their Chicago offices and had the amazing pleasure of meeting with the administrators of the PEPY NGO through a Skype call to empower them with the necessary knowledge they needed to raise more money to make a difference back in Cambodia. Check out the slides below if you want to learn more about what we discovered as a group.</p>
